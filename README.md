I wrote the code for the Sine shape as part of my Generative Drawing, sinusodial sketch assignment. 

The shape is created by manipulating the lower and upper bounds of two sine waves using the map() method in Javascript, adding the sum together, then multiplying the result by sine and cosine. The animation is created by mapping the bounds of the first two waves to the sine and cosine of frameCount (Multiplied by a fraction to control the speed).
